Hi Guys,

I have tried to automate a Demo site for an e-commerce application using the BDD framework ie Cucumber.

To Execute the same ,
Make sure you have all the selenium jars in your build path.
Since it's a Maven project , all the other dependencies will be automatically taken care of.

A brief on Cucumber :
Comprises of 3 files : 
1. Feature file - where you define all your test cases under the scenario 
2. Step definition file - where you will be writing all your actual code for the scenarios provided in the feature file
3. Test runner class - which will be executing your code as a Junit.
